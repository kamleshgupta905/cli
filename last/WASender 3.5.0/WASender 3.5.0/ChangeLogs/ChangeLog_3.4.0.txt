Changelog - 3.4.0 ( __ ___ 2024) -
------------------------------------------------------
* Contact Sender - Issues while sending Messages - Issue Resolved

* Sending Speed Improvement - Removed the 'Don't Check Number Status Before Sending Message' option from Settings and added 'Filter Numbers Before Sending Messages'. By default, this option will be OFF, meaning that while sending a message, the software will not check the number statusâ€”whether it is available on WhatsApp or not. If you want to filter it, turn this option ON, and the software will quickly filter all numbers just before sending messages. Previously, the software was filtering numbers one by one while sending messages, which was a very time-consuming process. But now, it will filter all numbers first before sending messages, then send messages one by one to the available numbers.

* Group Sender - Showing 'Failed-CantSend_Group_Admin_Only_Or_Removed' for Open Groups- Issue Resolved. Export fresh Group List from Contact List Grabber with this Latest Version again then Import it in Group Sender

* Autoreply Bot performance in Built in Browser is increased , no its 10X faster and quick

* For the 'Google Map Data Extractor' and 'Grab Group Links from Web' tools: these tools will now use Google Chrome as the browser. Previously, if you used the 'Built-in Browser', those tools were using Edge as the browser, so we needed to maintain both Chrome and Edge drivers up to date. Because of this change, we now only need to keep Chrome drivers updated. As a result, the 'Update Edge Driver' option is no longer needed and has been removed from Settings.

  this variable only works for the number which already present in your chat list or contact list
